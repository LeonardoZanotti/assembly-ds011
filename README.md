# assembly-ds011
This is some assembly files that i used to study for my ds011 subject on graduation.

The ```factorial.asm``` and ```factorial-with-pile.asm``` programs were developed by my teacher, Pedro Torres, but how i found it amazing im uploading this programs too. 

## MARS Assembly software

Im using the MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) software.
You can acess the official site of this software [here](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/index.htm).

I uploaded the software in this repository, so you can just proceed to **Running** to run the programs.

The Mars software in this repository is in the version 4.5.

## Running

```bash
# Clonning the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/LeonardoZanotti/assembly-ds011.git

# Enter the project folder
$ cd /assembly-ds011

# Run the software
$ java -jar Mars.jar
```

Now just open the files in the software by the menu File: ``` File -> Open -> (select the program.asm) ```
